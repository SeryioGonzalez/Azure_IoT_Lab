# Creating IoT applications

So far, we have seen different modules that highlight IoT application concepts for creating real IoT projects. This module will show a simple IoT application leveraging the concepts practices so far in all previous modules.
We are going to build an application that gets data from many devices and controls the temperature. For this module, we will focus on a single device, but the APP will scale to a large number of connecting devices
