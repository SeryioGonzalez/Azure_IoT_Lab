# APP sending data to devices

Unfortunately, product documentation might not be so well described as in this educational lab. In this final module we will use official product documentation from Microsoft for sending a device messages from an APP.

You should open an SSH session to the simulated client. I would advice using a text editor, such as notepad++ with the SFTP plugin for editing the code in an easier way.
